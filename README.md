Application of the local voting protocol for state synchronization in a decentralized network of mobile nodes

## Introduction
Modern realities create new problems and tasks that can be effectively solved with the help of groups of robots.
For the organization of group interaction, two main directions can be distinguished: centralized and decentralized. With centralized interaction, there is a control and information processing center that communicates with all nodes in the group. With decentralized - nodes communicate with each other, each node manages itself. Also, information processing occurs at each node.
